#### 谈论话题
##### 情形1： 如果没有想要谈论的话题，问候完后你可以使用一个常见的一般性问题:
```
How are you doing?
How are you today?
What's up?
What's happening?
What's going on?
How was your weekend?
```
##### 情形2： 特定问题.你可以向你认识的人询问他们的生活:
```
How was Peru?
How is your mom feeling?
```
##### 情形3： 在有些场合，你会有一个你想讨论的话题。你可以提出陈述，然后听众会对你的陈述发表意见:
```
A: Hey, there was a great movie on last night.
B: Really? What was it?
A: That was a great game last night!
B: Yeah, it was really exciting!
```
##### 情形4： 对话从一个话题转到另一个话题，有一些表达可以帮助人们暗示他们要改变话题:
```
(使用表达 **by the way** 来引入新话题，它也表示你刚想起了某事。)
A: By the way, I saw Joe last night. He looked good.
B: Really? I'm so glad!
(当你想起了想说的其他事情，使用 **that reminds me** 来转变话题。)
A: There was a great baseball game on TV last night.
B: Oh, that reminds me. I have two tickets to tonight's game. Do you want to go?
A: Yeah!
(使用单词 **anyway** 来结束或总结话题，这样一来你可以开始一个新话题。当你听厌了某人谈论某事，非常想改变话题时，就可以使用这个词。)
A: That restaurant wasn't very good.
B: No, it wasn't! The meat tasted bad, and the salad wasn't fresh. And the waiter was awful! His clothes were dirty!
A: Anyway, we're not going there again. So, how's Jane?
