# LEARNING
my learning memo

## Composition
1. part1 - quick start manual (basic/main ideas and corresponding coding samples)
1. part2 - practices (sample demo for clear/deep understanding)

## Next Step - Structure of Code
*Like a machine, I just design a **clear prototype** and then give it original power and join the evolution.*
